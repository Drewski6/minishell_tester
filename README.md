8. Some notes about the log file:
	1. The test number is the same number as the row number in the spreadsheet.
	2. Some tests are excluded and these are located in the ignore_list because they cause issues with the tester. You can add tests to this list if you like.

# ToDo:
	1. add a check for sections so the user can select if they want to check bonuses or not.
